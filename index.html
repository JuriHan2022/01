          What should we and how can we as designers allow our intensions to be
          clearly sought out tho the users who are using this site? Can being
          too specific ruin and cause confusion? How much information is just
          right for the user to truly understand the intensions?

          When someone makes there is a set of instruction they intend the users
          to follow. However, it is unclear how the user will stray. The amount
          of protocol and freedom, the variations once can have while can be fun
          to play with in the process of making is not beautiful as the end
          result
